## PROJECT : App Success Prediction
**Problem statement:**  Huge number of apps in the play store and the numbers of the app release every day make it quite competitive for                           the app developers to get app popular and successful in market.
***
**Data details**:
   * Data accessed from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps)  
   * Web scraped data of 10k Play Store apps for analysing the Android market.  
   * Data download size is 2MB.

## Project Outline:   
   **1.Data Preparation=Data Cleaning + feature engineering** 
       *Basics (select, filter, removal of duplicates, …)   
       *Sampling (balanced, stratified, ...)   
       *Data Partitioning (create training + validation + test data set, ...)   
       *Transformations (normalisation, standardisation, scaling, pivoting, ...)   
       *Binning (count-based, handling of missing values as its own group, …)   
       *Data Replacement (cutting, splitting, merging, ...)   
       *Weighting and Selection (attribute weighting, automatic optimization, ...)   
       *Attribute Generation (ID generation, ...)   
       *Imputation (replacement of missing observations by using statistical algorithms)   
   **2.Data Collection:**       
   **3.EDA:**        
   **4.Model Building:**        
   **5.Model validation:**       
   **6.Model Execution:**      
   **7.Model Deployment:**
